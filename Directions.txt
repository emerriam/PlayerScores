Requirements:

* Write a program that takes in a file which contains points for an imaginary game and outputs a leaderboard, ie `ruby your_program input_file.csv`.
* Each line of input file will contain first name of a person along with points they were awarded. The points will always be an integer, but can be -/+.
* input_file.csv will be a CSV file in the following format:

Jack,1
John,2
David,1
Jack,-1

* Your program should output summary of total points of users in DESC order to STDOUT.
* The summary should include name, followed by `:`, followed by total points.

John: 2
David: 1
Jack: 0

* Please write unit tests.

Note:

* Assume input_file.csv and each line in it to be valid CSV syntax.
* You might be asked to extend the program, so please architect with that in mind. Think about which of the requirements can change or extend with further
functionality.
* You may use rspec or minitest or testunit for tests.

Submission:

In addition to the code and test file, include a README that explains:

* Overview design decisions
* How to run code and tests

Please zip all three files and email it to senthil@walkerandcobrands.com.
